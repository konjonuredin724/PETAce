# PETAce

Privacy-Enhancing Technologies via Applied Cryptography Engineering (PETAce) enables fast prototyping of ideas based on privacy-enhancing technologies.
PETAce is a long-term development project and is planned to catch up with state-of-the-art research results in future releases.
It is implemented in C++ and is modularized into the following repositories.

- [PETAce-Solo](https://github.com/tiktok-privacy-innovation/PETAce-Solo) implements primitive hashing, encryption, and randomness generation algorithms performed by one party.
- [PETAce-Verse](https://github.com/tiktok-privacy-innovation/PETAce-Verse) includes frequently used cryptographic subprotocols such as oblivious transfer and oblivious shuffling.
- [PETAce-Duet](https://github.com/tiktok-privacy-innovation/PETAce-Duet) abstracts general-purpose two-party secure computing operator protocols.
- [PETAce-SetOps](https://github.com/tiktok-privacy-innovation/PETAce-SetOps) archives several protocols that perform private set operations.
- [PETAce-Network](https://github.com/tiktok-privacy-innovation/PETAce-Network) provides a preliminary interface of network communication.
